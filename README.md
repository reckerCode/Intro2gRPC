Introduction repo for gRPC 


gRPC is a high preformance, open source Remote Procedure Call framework initially developed by Google. It helps in eliminating boilerplate code and helps i connectinng polyglot services in and across data centers.

The framework is based on a client-server model of remote prodedure calles. A client application can directly call methods on a server application as if it was a local object.

What is included in this repo:
  Definied a service in a .proto file
  Generate server and client code using the protocol buffer compiler
  Creating the server application, implementing the generated service interfaced and spawing the gRPC server
  Creating the client application, making PRC calls using generated stubs.
